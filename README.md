When the game loads, you will choose your player by clicking on one of the four player profiles displayed at the top of the screen. Once you have done so, the program will move your player under the "Your Player" section of the screen and prompt you to pick your first opponent. Once you have selected your first opponent, you are ready to initiate your 1v1 game.

### 1v1 Game
* To attack your opponent, click the basketball icon next to your character
* Whenever you attack, your opponent will instantly respond with a counterattack 
* You and your opponent's health points will decrease by the power of the opposing player's attack / counterattack
* Your attack power will increase by its base attack value each time you attack
    * For example, if your initial attack power is 12, then it will increase to 24 after your first attack, 36 after your second attack, etc.
    * Your opponents counterattack power will never change
* Continue clicking on the attack button until you win or lose the 1v1 game
    * If you lose, the game will automatically reset 
    * If you win, the game will prompt you to select another opponent
* Once you have defeated all possible opponents, you can call yourself an NBA champion

## Development
